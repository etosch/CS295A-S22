# Basic Blog post in Markdown

You can write your blog posts in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/), no headers required!

## Basic rendering options

AFAIK most general markdown is supported. 

Mathematical notation is rendered using [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org). This means you can write LaTeX as you would in math mode and it will render. For example,

```$e = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}$```

renders as 

$e = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{n!}$.

You can also use inline symbols, e.g., $\pi, \sigma, \tau, \forall, \exists, \square, \diamond, \vdash,$ etc.

I'd love to support [diagrams](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams/), but this feature is not yet publicly available for the Material theme. If you come across a plugin that works with Material and Github pages and have tested that things work locally, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/uvm-maple/CS295A-S22/pulls).

Here is a link to a picture, in case you want to upload photographs of hand-written diagrams, etc.:
